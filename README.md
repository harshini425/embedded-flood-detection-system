## embedded-flood-detection-system
An embedded system designed to detect rising water levels and rainfall conditions in flood-prone areas using simulated sensors. The system generates early alerts based on predefined threshold logic. Designed and validated using embedded controller logic in a simulated environment.


## Overview
An embedded system designed to detect rising water levels and rainfall conditions in flood-prone areas using simulated sensors.  
The system generates early alerts based on predefined threshold logic.  
Designed and validated using embedded controller logic in a simulated environment.

## Objective
To design a low-cost embedded flood detection system capable of monitoring water-related parameters and providing early warning alerts to reduce flood risks.

## Tools
